# Online-Retail-Dataset-Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to apply collective knowledge from the Programming for Business Analytics module to analyze the Online Retail II dataset. The analysis will be conducted using Python or MATLAB. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset to derive actionable business insights and improve decision-making processes.

## Tasks

1. Dataset Download

Download the Online Retail II dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.


2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This includes:

Handling missing values
Detecting outliers
Normalizing data
Performing feature engineering


3. Feature Engineering

Explain how the newly created features add business value and their potential application in predictive modeling.


4. Code Implementation

Implement the necessary code to clean and preprocess the data.
Describe each step of the process and justify the methods used in the context of improving business decision-making.


5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA using Python (matplotlib, seaborn) or MATLAB.
Discuss the business implications of identified patterns, such as:
Key customer segments
Prediction of future sales
Optimization of marketing efforts based on observed correlations
Provide clear and well-labeled visualizations to support insights (use no more than 5 images).


6. Customer Classification

Write a Python for loop to classify customers into three categories based on the number of purchases:
High-value customers: purchases > 100
Medium-value customers: purchases between 50 and 100
Low-value customers: purchases < 50
Store this classification in a new column called customer_category.


7. Monthly Sales Analysis

Using NumPy, create a 2D array representing the monthly sales for 6 products (Engine, Tyre, Key, Glass, Computer, Chair) over a 12-month period.
Perform the following operations on the array:
Calculate the total sales for each product across all months.
Find the month with the highest sales for each product.
Calculate the overall mean of sales for the entire array.
Ensure the solution is clean, effective, and applicable to real business scenarios.
